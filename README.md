# OpenEval Submission: Einstein's Relativity Explained by a Geography Teacher

## Overview

This case simulates a scenario where a 50-year-old geography teacher must suddenly explain Einstein's theory of relativity to 14–15-year-old students, despite having no prior knowledge of the topic. The teacher constructs a lesson that is then evaluated by five fictional observers representing different cognitive and professional lenses (physicist, mathematician, science fiction writer, politician, psychologist).
