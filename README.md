# OpenEval Case: Einstein’s Relativity by a Geography Teacher

This case explores how a non-expert character — a 50-year-old geography teacher — is suddenly tasked with explaining Einstein’s theory of relativity to students aged 14–15, without prior knowledge. The goal is to simulate high-pressure improvisation, educational adaptation, and cognitive response modeling across diverse observer types.

## 🧪 Scenario Overview

- **Persona:** 50-year-old male geography teacher  
- **Audience:** 500 students (age 14–15, regular school)  
- **Task:** Deliver a convincing lesson on Einstein’s relativity in one session  
- **Constraint:** Teacher must *appear* competent, despite no prior expertise  
- **Goal:** Model clarity, adaptation, and audience perception under pressure

## 🔍 Key Dimensions Tested

- Audience modeling and perception variance  
- Role simulation under knowledge constraints  
- Multi-observer evaluation (physicist, mathematician, SF writer, politician, psychologist)  
- Style adaptation (50%, 70%, 90%) with divergence analysis  
- Showcase formatting and evaluation tagging

## 🔗 Suggested Use

This submission is suitable for:

- Open-eval testing environments  
- AI educational reasoning evaluation  
- Narrative prompting studies  
- Showcase portfolios in LLM simulation design ##
- 🧠 Observer Verdicts

This case includes two versions of a synthetic observer's meta-assessment, offering both expressive and filtered perspectives:

- 🔍 **[Expressive MetaPortrait](Einstein_MetaPortrait_ObserverVerdict.md)**  
  A narratively rich reflection on the structure and impact of the case. Best for readers interested in interpretive depth and cognitive storytelling.

- 📊 **[Analytical Verdict (Praise-Filtered)](Einstein_MetaPortrait_PraiseFiltered.md)**  
  A neutral and audit-friendly evaluation focused on simulation framing, alignment structure, and applicability for educational prompt design.

> *Including both versions showcases not only the case content, but also the evaluative transparency and prompt-layer reflexivity of the author.*
